Project Title:  
"Career Aspirations of Gen Z"

Objectives:
1. Analyze Career Aspirations:
   - To identify and understand the career motivations, job expectations, and work-life balance preferences of Gen Z employees.
  
2. Provide Employer Insights:
   - To offer data-driven insights that employers can use to improve recruitment, retention, and engagement strategies for Gen Z talent.

3. Identify Key Challenges:
   - To recognize the main challenges employers face in managing Gen Z employees, such as technology adaptation, retention, and aligning work-life balance expectations.

4. Develop Strategic Recommendations:
   - To create a practical set of recommendations for organizations to implement, improving Gen Z recruitment and retention strategies.

Scope of Work:
1. Survey Design:
   - I created a detailed survey using Google Forms, targeting Gen Z individuals across various regions and demographics to gather information about their career preferences, motivations, and challenges.
   - The survey included over 25 different questions, focusing on key areas like work-life balance, career progression, workplace flexibility, and technology expectations.

2. Data Collection & Cleaning:
   - After launching the survey via social media channels, I gathered over 200 responses.
   - I used Excel and SQL to clean the dataset, ensuring consistency and removing duplicates to prepare the data for analysis.

3. Data Analysis & Visualization:
   - Using Power BI, I visualized key insights from the data, creating dashboards that highlighted Gen Z's career aspirations, employer challenges, and preferences.
   - I focused on creating multiple dashboards to visualize these insights, similar to my previous experience with multi-page Power BI reports in sectors like banking, sales, and hospitality.

4. Stakeholder Insights:
   - I conducted focus group discussions to supplement the survey findings, gathering qualitative insights on what drives Gen Z's career choices.
   - Insights from this data were shared in reports and visualizations to offer stakeholders a comprehensive view of the generational shift happening in workplaces.

Key Findings:
1. Top Career Aspirations of Gen Z:
   - Work-Life Balance: A majority of Gen Z (80%) prioritize flexible work hours and remote working opportunities.
   - Job Security: 65% of respondents seek stability in their roles, contrary to the stereotype of frequent job-hopping.
   - Career Development: Around 70% value continuous learning opportunities, mentorship, and clear career progression paths.

2. Challenges for Employers:
   - Retention Issues: Gen Z employees expect rapid career advancement, and many organizations struggle with retaining this generation.
   - Technology Expectations: Gen Z is highly tech-savvy, and employers often struggle to meet their expectations for advanced tools and digital solutions.

3. Workplace Preferences:
   - Flexibility vs. Salary: 75% of Gen Z respondents favor workplace flexibility (remote work, flexible schedules) over a higher salary.
   - Diversity and Inclusion: 75% value companies that actively promote diversity and inclusion.

Key "Wow" Insight:
- Flexibility Over Salary: One of the most surprising insights was that 75% of Gen Z participants prioritize workplace flexibility over a higher salary. This was a major shift from previous generations, where compensation was often the top motivator. The preference for remote work and flexible hours has become a defining feature of this generation's workplace expectations.

Recommendations:
1. Flexible Work Policies:
   - Employers should implement remote work options and flexible work hours to better align with Gen Z's preference for work-life balance.

2. Continuous Career Development:
   - Organizations should invest in mentorship programs, skill development, and clear career progression pathways to retain Gen Z talent.

3. Diversity and Inclusion:
   - Employers should actively promote and invest in diversity and inclusion initiatives to create a work culture that resonates with Gen Z values.

4. Technology Investments:

Tools and Technologies Used:
- Survey Design: Google Forms
- Data Collection & Cleaning: Excel, SQL

- Data Visualization: Power BI (multiple dashboards created)
- Presentation: Canva, PowerPoint (for final presentation slides)

Challenges Faced:
1. Survey Response Rate:
   - In the early stages of the project, I struggled to gather enough survey responses. I overcame this challenge by promoting the survey across social media platforms and reaching out directly to Gen Z individuals to improve the response rate.

2. Data Cleaning:
   - Ensuring that the survey data was consistent and error-free was a time-consuming task, requiring careful use of SQL and Excel to clean and transform the dataset.

3. Visualizing Insights:
   - Creating clear and impactful visualizations in Power BI that could effectively communicate the findings to employers was a challenge. My previous experience in creating multi-page Power BI reports for banking, sales, healthcare, and hospitality sectors helped me deliver comprehensive visual reports.

Key Takeaways:
